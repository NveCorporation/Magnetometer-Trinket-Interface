# Magnetometer-Trinket-Interface
A GMR magnetometer sensor is connected to an Arduino Trinket

Amplification, offset correction, and temperature-compensation of 
an NVE GMR sensor using an ATtiny85 Trinket board. Sensor OUT- to PB3/A3; 
OUT+ to PB4/A2; PWM output on PB0; digital threshold output to red LED (PB1).

Trinkets are small and inexpesnive, and the ATtiny processors are ideal
for this type of sensor because they have internal preamps.
